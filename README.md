### Hello, World!

This is where I keep my personal projects.  

My open source [Image Processing](https://github.com/freedom35/image-processing) library is available as a package on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Freedom35.ImageProcessing).

My ASP.NET Core web app to track the clubs used by pro golfers can be found over on [thatgolfproject.com](https://www.thatgolfproject.com).

You can also find me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/think3r202/), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/think3r202) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alanbarr716).
